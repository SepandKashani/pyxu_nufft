Known Issues: Cause Known (& Fixable?)
    [OK] DASK-case: Fixture[_op_asarray, width=DOUBLE] does not denote the true ground-truth due to DASK-based FFT()
         error accumulation.  Not really a problem because errors are in 1e-7 range, but did not look into how to fix
         them yet.
        TestFFS::test_value_asarray
    [OK] DASK-case: fails because generated test data does not match chunking structure of (`op._x`, `op._v`).
         These tests were not designed with chunk-size restrictions in mind. Can probably make then chunk-aware,
         but not a priority at the moment.
         We note that these tests work on NUMPY inputs, so the operators are correct.
